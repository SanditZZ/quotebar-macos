# ci-watch.sh — wait for the GitHub Actions runs for the current commit and
# report a single, trustworthy verdict.
#
# Two things make this less trivial than `gh run watch`:
#
#   1. **Runs are matched by commit, not branch.** A run takes a few seconds to
#      appear after a push; asking for "the latest run on this branch" inside
#      that window returns the *previous* commit's run, which may be green while
#      the new one has not even started — a success that says nothing about what
#      was just pushed.
#
#   2. **A `cancelled` run is not a failure, and not a pass either.** CI no
#      longer fires twice for one commit — that duplicate was removed because
#      GitHub counted the cancelled half against the PR — but a run can still
#      be superseded by a newer push, so the verdict has to come from the run
#      that actually finished rather than from whatever ran last.
#
# Note: CI runs on pull requests and on `main`. Pushing a branch that has no PR
# yet produces no run at all, and this script will report "nothing conclusive"
# — that is expected, not a fault. `scripts/ci-local.sh` is the check that
# covers that window.
#
# It also passes the personal account's token per invocation: `gh` defaults to
# the work account on this machine, and switching the active account would
# affect every other shell.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci-watch.sh              # current commit
#   scripts/ci-watch.sh <sha>        # a specific commit
#
# Exit codes: 0 all good · 1 a run failed · 2 nothing conclusive
