# ci-local.sh — run exactly what CI runs, locally.
#
# GitHub Actions only reports after a push, which is too late. This runs the
# same two xcodebuild invocations as .github/workflows/ci.yml with the same
# flags, so a red pipeline is caught before anything leaves the machine.
#
# Requires Xcode 26+ (the FoundationModels framework is only in that SDK).
#
# Keep this file and .github/workflows/ci.yml in step: if one gains a flag, so
# must the other, or "it passed locally" stops meaning anything.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci-local.sh             # build + frameworks + test
#   scripts/ci-local.sh build       # build only
#   scripts/ci-local.sh frameworks  # check embedded frameworks only
#   scripts/ci-local.sh test        # test only
#
# Exit code is 0 only when every stage passed.
