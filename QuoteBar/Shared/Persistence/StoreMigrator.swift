//  The side-effecting half of `StoreMigration`: copies the sandboxed store to
//  the unsandboxed location on first launch after the sandbox was removed.
//
//  Copies, never moves. The container copy stays put as a free backup — if
//  anything about this goes wrong the original database is still sitting
//  exactly where it always was, and the user loses nothing.
